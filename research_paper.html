        <h1>Predicting Retail Store Success in Urban Areas Using Machine Learning: A Case Study of Pune City</h1>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>The success of retail businesses heavily depends on location selection, yet traditional methods of site evaluation remain largely subjective and limited in scope. This research presents a comprehensive machine learning approach to predict retail store success by analyzing geospatial, demographic, and infrastructure data. Using data from 16,628 retail establishments across Pune city, we developed category-specific prediction models that achieved an average accuracy of 70.3%, with the best-performing model (Retail Electronics) reaching 75.6% accuracy. Our approach integrates multiple data sources including Google Places API, OpenStreetMap, and census data to engineer 35+ features capturing location quality, accessibility, and market dynamics. The models successfully identify key success factors for different retail categories while maintaining generalizability to new, unseen locations. This work demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in retail location intelligence and provides actionable insights for entrepreneurs, investors, and urban planners.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1 Background and Motivation</h3>
<p>Choosing the right location is one of the most critical decisions for retail businesses. A well-chosen location can drive foot traffic, enhance visibility, and ensure long-term profitability, while a poor location choice often leads to business failure regardless of product quality or service excellence. Traditional location analysis methods rely heavily on manual surveys, expert intuition, and limited demographic data, making them time-consuming, expensive, and prone to subjective bias.</p>
<p>The rapid growth of geospatial data availability and advances in machine learning present new opportunities to revolutionize retail location intelligence. Modern data sources like Google Places API, OpenStreetMap, and government census databases provide rich information about existing businesses, infrastructure, demographics, and points of interest. When combined with sophisticated machine learning algorithms, this data can reveal complex patterns that determine retail success.</p>
<h3>1.2 Research Problem</h3>
<p>Despite the abundance of available data, several challenges remain in predicting retail store success:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Integration Complexity</strong>: Retail success depends on multiple factors spanning different data sources and spatial scales, making integration challenging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Category-Specific Requirements</strong>: Different retail types (food, fashion, electronics) have distinct success drivers that generic models fail to capture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Generalizability Issues</strong>: Models trained on specific locations often fail when applied to new areas due to over-reliance on location-specific features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Class Imbalance</strong>: Real-world data shows that most established stores have positive ratings, creating imbalanced datasets that bias model predictions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>1.3 Research Objectives</h3>
<p>This research aims to address these challenges through the following objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Collect and integrate comprehensive geospatial data covering retail stores, infrastructure, demographics, and accessibility metrics for Pune city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engineer meaningful features that capture the complex relationships between location characteristics and retail success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop category-specific machine learning models for different retail types (Food, Retail General, Retail Fashion, Retail Electronics, and Services).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieve prediction accuracy exceeding 70% while ensuring models can generalize to new, unseen locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify and interpret key success factors for each retail category to provide actionable business insights.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>1.4 Contributions</h3>
<p>Our work makes several key contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Dataset</strong>: We collected and integrated data from 16,628 retail stores with rich geospatial features from multiple sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Novel Feature Engineering</strong>: We developed 35+ features including category-specific metrics that capture nuanced success factors for different retail types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Generalizable Models</strong>: By removing location-specific categorical features, our models work for any location within the city and can be adapted to other cities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practical Insights</strong>: Our feature importance analysis reveals actionable insights about what drives success in each retail category.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Related Work and Background</h2>
<p>Retail location analysis has been studied extensively from both business and technical perspectives. Traditional approaches in retail geography focus on factors like centrality, accessibility, and competition using manual surveys and simple statistical methods. While these provide valuable insights, they lack the predictive power and scalability of modern machine learning approaches.</p>
<p>Recent work in machine learning for retail has explored various algorithms including logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting for predicting store performance. However, most studies focus on single retail categories or use limited feature sets. Our work extends this by developing category-specific models with comprehensive feature engineering and explicit handling of generalizability constraints.</p>
<p>The use of geospatial data in retail analytics has grown with the availability of APIs like Google Places and OpenStreetMap. These sources provide rich information about existing businesses, infrastructure, and points of interest. Our research leverages these modern data sources while addressing their inherent challenges like data quality and integration complexity.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3. Methodology</h2>
<h3>3.1 Study Area and Data Collection</h3>
<p>Our study focuses on Pune city, Maharashtra, India—a rapidly growing metropolitan area with diverse retail landscapes spanning traditional markets, modern shopping districts, and emerging commercial zones. This diversity makes Pune an ideal testbed for developing generalizable retail prediction models.</p>
<h4>3.1.1 Store Data Collection</h4>
<p>We collected data on 16,628 retail establishments using the Google Places API. To ensure comprehensive coverage, we implemented a grid-based search strategy dividing Pune into 500m × 500m cells and querying each cell for retail businesses. For each store, we collected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude)</li>
<li>Store name and unique Place ID</li>
<li>Business types and categories</li>
<li>User ratings (1-5 scale)</li>
<li>Total number of user reviews</li>
<li>Address information</li>
</ul>
<p>The dataset includes various retail types: restaurants, cafes, supermarkets, clothing stores, electronics stores, pharmacies, salons, and gyms. This comprehensive collection provides a representative sample of Pune's retail ecosystem.</p>
<h4>3.1.2 Footfall Generator Data</h4>
<p>Retail success heavily depends on proximity to locations that generate foot traffic. We identified and collected data on 2,500+ footfall generators using OpenStreetMap's Overpass API, categorized as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shopping Centers</strong>: Malls and shopping complexes</li>
<li><strong>Educational Institutions</strong>: Colleges, universities, and schools</li>
<li><strong>IT Parks and Offices</strong>: Technology parks and business centers</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Facilities</strong>: Hospitals and major clinics</li>
<li><strong>Entertainment Venues</strong>: Theaters, parks, and tourist attractions</li>
</ul>
<p>These locations serve as anchors that drive customer traffic to nearby retail establishments.</p>
<h4>3.1.3 Transit Accessibility Data</h4>
<p>Public transportation access significantly impacts retail accessibility. We collected data on 1,800+ transit stops including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PMPML bus stops (Pune Municipal Transport)</li>
<li>Pune Metro stations</li>
<li>Railway stations (local and intercity)</li>
</ul>
<p>This data enables us to quantify how easily customers can reach different retail locations.</p>
<h4>3.1.4 Demographic and Economic Data</h4>
<p>We integrated census data and real estate information to capture the economic characteristics of different areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Population density by ward</li>
<li>Average monthly income (estimated from property prices and area characteristics)</li>
<li>Property prices per square foot</li>
<li>Commercial rent rates by zone</li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics help understand the purchasing power and market potential of different locations.</p>
<h4>3.1.5 Infrastructure Data</h4>
<p>Infrastructure quality affects both accessibility and visibility. We collected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Road network data from OpenStreetMap</li>
<li>Road density calculations (km of roads per sq km)</li>
<li>Commercial rent rates by zone (South Pune, West Pune, East Pune, PCMC)</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.2 Data Preprocessing</h3>
<h4>3.2.1 Success Label Definition</h4>
<p>A critical challenge in retail prediction is defining "success." We developed a composite criterion based on customer ratings and review volume:</p>
<p>A store is labeled as <strong>successful</strong> if:
- Rating ≥ 4.0 AND Total reviews ≥ 50 (established and well-rated), OR
- Rating ≥ 4.5 (exceptional quality regardless of establishment time)</p>
<p>This definition captures both sustained success (high ratings with many reviews) and exceptional quality (very high ratings even for newer stores). The resulting dataset shows approximately 78% of stores as successful, reflecting the natural survival bias in our data—poorly performing stores tend to close and disappear from the dataset.</p>
<h4>3.2.2 Category Classification</h4>
<p>We developed a rule-based classification system to categorize stores into six main types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Food</strong>: Restaurants, cafes, bakeries (694 stores, 4.2%)</li>
<li><strong>Retail General</strong>: Supermarkets, general stores (8,458 stores, 50.9%)</li>
<li><strong>Retail Fashion</strong>: Clothing, shoes, jewelry (4,833 stores, 29.1%)</li>
<li><strong>Retail Electronics</strong>: Electronics stores (2,302 stores, 13.8%)</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong>: Salons, spas, gyms (149 stores, 0.9%)</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong>: Pharmacies, drugstores (19 stores, 0.1%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to insufficient data, we excluded the Health category from modeling. The distribution reflects Pune's retail composition, with general retail dominating followed by fashion and electronics.</p>
<h4>3.2.3 Spatial Integration</h4>
<p>We performed spatial joins to assign each store to administrative and analytical units:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grid cells</strong>: 500m × 500m cells for spatial aggregation</li>
<li><strong>Wards</strong>: Administrative boundaries for demographic data</li>
<li><strong>Zones</strong>: Commercial zones for rent categorization</li>
</ul>
<p>This multi-level spatial structure enables feature engineering at different scales.</p>
<h3>3.3 Feature Engineering</h3>
<p>Feature engineering is crucial for capturing the complex factors that drive retail success. We developed 35+ features organized into several categories.</p>
<h4>3.3.1 Base Location Features</h4>
<p>These features capture the fundamental geographic characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Coordinates</strong>: Grid cell center latitude and longitude</li>
<li><strong>Distance to city center</strong>: Euclidean distance to Pune's central business district</li>
<li><strong>Distance to locality center</strong>: Distance to the nearest major locality</li>
<li><strong>Distance to ward center</strong>: Distance to administrative ward center</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.3.2 Competition Features</h4>
<p>Understanding the competitive landscape is essential:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Competitor count</strong>: Number of same-category stores within 1km radius</li>
<li><strong>Nearest competitor distance</strong>: Distance to the closest competitor</li>
<li><strong>Competition density</strong>: Competitors normalized by local population</li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics help identify oversaturated markets versus underserved areas.</p>
<h4>3.3.3 Infrastructure and Accessibility Features</h4>
<p>Infrastructure quality affects both customer access and operational costs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Road density</strong>: Total road length per square kilometer</li>
<li><strong>Distance to major roads</strong>: Proximity to main thoroughfares</li>
<li><strong>Commercial rent</strong>: Rent per square foot by zone</li>
<li><strong>Transit stop count</strong>: Number of bus/metro stops within 500m</li>
<li><strong>Transit stop distance</strong>: Distance to nearest transit stop</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.3.4 Demographic and Economic Features</h4>
<p>Market potential depends on local demographics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total population</strong>: Population in the ward</li>
<li><strong>Average monthly income</strong>: Estimated income levels</li>
<li><strong>Property prices</strong>: Real estate values per square foot</li>
<li><strong>Purchasing power index</strong>: Composite economic metric</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.3.5 Footfall Features</h4>
<p>Proximity to foot traffic generators is critical:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Footfall generator count</strong>: Number of malls, colleges, IT parks within 1km</li>
<li><strong>Nearest generator distance</strong>: Distance to closest generator</li>
<li><strong>User ratings total</strong>: Existing customer engagement (for established stores)</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.3.6 Engineered Composite Features</h4>
<p>We created seven sophisticated features combining multiple base metrics:</p>
<p><strong>1. Transit Accessibility Score</strong></p>
<pre><code>transit_accessibility_score = transit_stop_count / (nearest_transit_m / 1000 + 1)
</code></pre>
<p>This combines both the density of transit options and proximity to the nearest stop, providing a comprehensive measure of public transport access.</p>
<p><strong>2. Footfall Accessibility Score</strong></p>
<pre><code>footfall_accessibility_score = footfall_generator_count / (nearest_generator_m / 1000 + 1)
</code></pre>
<p>Similar to transit accessibility, this captures both the number of nearby footfall generators and proximity to the closest one.</p>
<p><strong>3. Rent-to-Income Ratio</strong></p>
<pre><code>rent_to_income_ratio = commercial_rent_per_sqft / (avg_monthly_income + 1)
</code></pre>
<p>This measures affordability—lower ratios indicate locations where rent is sustainable relative to local purchasing power.</p>
<p><strong>4. Competition Density</strong></p>
<pre><code>competition_density = competitor_count / (total_population / 1000 + 1)
</code></pre>
<p>This normalizes competition by market size, distinguishing between high competition in large markets versus oversaturation in small markets.</p>
<p><strong>5. Market Saturation</strong></p>
<pre><code>market_saturation = competitor_count / (footfall_generator_count + 1)
</code></pre>
<p>This ratio of supply (competitors) to demand drivers (footfall generators) identifies oversupplied markets.</p>
<p><strong>6. Connectivity Score</strong></p>
<pre><code>connectivity_score = road_density_km * transit_accessibility_score
</code></pre>
<p>This composite metric combines road infrastructure with public transit access.</p>
<p><strong>7. Distance to City Center</strong>
Calculated using the Haversine formula to measure great-circle distance from each location to Pune's central business district.</p>
<h4>3.3.7 Category-Specific Features</h4>
<p>Different retail types have unique success drivers. We engineered five custom features for each category:</p>
<p><strong>Food Category Features:</strong>
- <strong>Evening potential</strong>: Footfall generators × transit accessibility (captures dinner crowd)
- <strong>Residential proximity</strong>: Inverse of distance to city center (daily customer base)
- <strong>Office proximity</strong>: Footfall generator count (lunch crowd)
- <strong>Transit access</strong>: Transit accessibility score (convenience)
- <strong>Rent affordability</strong>: Income / rent ratio</p>
<p><strong>Retail Fashion Features:</strong>
- <strong>Income sensitivity</strong>: Income / rent ratio (fashion is income-dependent)
- <strong>Visibility score</strong>: Road density × footfall accessibility (window shopping importance)
- <strong>Shopping district score</strong>: Competitor count × footfall accessibility (clustering effect)
- <strong>Parking accessibility</strong>: Transit accessibility as proxy
- <strong>Market opportunity</strong>: Purchasing power / competition density</p>
<p><strong>Retail Electronics Features:</strong>
- <strong>Tech hub proximity</strong>: Footfall generator count (IT parks, colleges)
- <strong>High-value customer score</strong>: Income × purchasing power
- <strong>Showroom accessibility</strong>: Connectivity × transit accessibility
- <strong>Competition intensity</strong>: Competitors / population
- <strong>Market potential</strong>: Purchasing power / competition density</p>
<p><strong>Services Category Features:</strong>
- <strong>Repeat customer potential</strong>: Population density
- <strong>Convenience score</strong>: Transit accessibility + connectivity
- <strong>Premium service potential</strong>: Income × purchasing power
- <strong>Mixed-use score</strong>: Footfall generators + residential proximity
- <strong>Market opportunity</strong>: Population / competitors</p>
<p>These category-specific features capture the nuanced requirements of different retail types.</p>
<h4>3.3.8 Handling Location-Specific Features</h4>
<p>A critical design decision was removing location-specific categorical features. Initial models included one-hot encoded features like <code>locality_Hinjewadi</code>, <code>locality_Wakad</code>, and <code>rental_zone_South_Pune</code>. While these improved training accuracy, they prevented generalization to new locations not in the training data.</p>
<p>We removed all such features and retained only:
- <strong>Numeric distance features</strong>: <code>locality_dist_m</code>, <code>ward_dist_m</code> (work for any location)
- <strong>Generalizable categorical features</strong>: <code>tier</code> (Grade A/B/C), <code>confidence</code> (data quality), <code>income_tier</code> (Low/Medium/High)</p>
<p>This ensures our models can predict for any location within Pune and can be adapted to other cities.</p>
<h3>3.4 Model Development</h3>
<h4>3.4.1 Algorithm Selection</h4>
<p>We chose XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) as our primary algorithm for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Superior Performance</strong>: XGBoost consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on tabular data</li>
<li><strong>Built-in Regularization</strong>: L1 and L2 regularization prevent overfitting</li>
<li><strong>Handles Imbalance</strong>: The <code>scale_pos_weight</code> parameter addresses class imbalance</li>
<li><strong>Feature Importance</strong>: Provides interpretable feature rankings</li>
<li><strong>Computational Efficiency</strong>: Histogram-based algorithm enables fast training</li>
</ol>
<p>We compared XGBoost against Random Forest and Logistic Regression baselines, with XGBoost showing 3-5% higher accuracy.</p>
<h4>3.4.2 Handling Class Imbalance</h4>
<p>Our dataset exhibits significant class imbalance with 78% successful stores versus 22% failures. This reflects real-world survival bias but can cause models to simply predict "success" for all cases.</p>
<p>We addressed this using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), which creates synthetic examples of the minority class by interpolating between existing samples. For example, in the Retail General category:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before SMOTE: 5,183 training samples (78% success)</li>
<li>After SMOTE: 8,130 training samples (50% success, 50% failure)</li>
</ul>
<p>SMOTE was applied only to the training set to avoid data leakage, ensuring test set evaluation remains unbiased.</p>
<h4>3.4.3 Train-Test Split and Cross-Validation</h4>
<p>We used stratified train-test splitting with an 80-20 ratio, ensuring both sets maintain the original class distribution. Additionally, we performed 5-fold stratified cross-validation to validate model stability and generalization.</p>
<p>The cross-validation process:
1. Split data into 5 equal folds
2. Maintain class distribution in each fold (stratified)
3. Train on 4 folds, validate on 1 fold
4. Repeat 5 times with each fold serving as validation once
5. Report mean accuracy ± standard deviation</p>
<p>Low standard deviation indicates stable, reliable performance.</p>
<h4>3.4.4 Hyperparameter Optimization</h4>
<p>We optimized hyperparameters for each category based on dataset size and characteristics. The key parameters and their effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>n_estimators</strong> (number of trees): Increased to 1000 for better learning</li>
<li><strong>max_depth</strong> (tree depth): 5-8 depending on dataset size (deeper for larger datasets)</li>
<li><strong>learning_rate</strong>: Reduced to 0.02 for slower, more stable learning</li>
<li><strong>min_child_weight</strong>: Higher for smaller datasets (more regularization)</li>
<li><strong>subsample &amp; colsample_bytree</strong>: 0.8-0.9 (controls randomness)</li>
<li><strong>gamma</strong>: Pruning parameter (higher for smaller datasets)</li>
<li><strong>reg_alpha &amp; reg_lambda</strong>: L1 and L2 regularization</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the Retail General category (largest dataset) uses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">{
    'n_estimators': 1000,
    'max_depth': 8,        # Deeper trees for complex patterns
    'learning_rate': 0.02,
    'min_child_weight': 3,  # Less regularization
    'subsample': 0.9,
    'colsample_bytree': 0.9,
    'gamma': 0.1,
    'reg_alpha': 1.0,
    'reg_lambda': 1.5
}
</code></pre>
<p>While the Services category (smallest dataset) uses more conservative parameters:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">{
    'n_estimators': 800,
    'max_depth': 5,         # Shallower trees
    'learning_rate': 0.03,
    'min_child_weight': 6,  # More regularization
    'subsample': 0.8,
    'colsample_bytree': 0.8,
    'gamma': 0.25,          # More pruning
    'reg_alpha': 1.7,
    'reg_lambda': 2.2
}
</code></pre>

</table>
<p>Several observations stand out:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Retail Electronics</strong> achieved the highest accuracy (75.6%), likely due to clear success factors like tech hub proximity and high-income customer base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High precision</strong> (80.5% average) indicates our models have low false positive rates—when they predict success, they're usually correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High recall</strong> (82.5% average) shows good detection of successful stores, important for identifying promising locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cross-validation scores</strong> are higher than test scores, expected when using SMOTE on training data. The low standard deviations (0.5-4.1%) indicate stable performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Services category</strong> shows the lowest test accuracy (64.0%) but high CV accuracy (80.5%), likely due to the small dataset size (only 123 stores).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Accuracy Comparison" src="file:///c:/Users/91915/OneDrive/Desktop/final%20year%20project/models/plots/comparison/accuracy_comparison.png" /></p>
<p>The accuracy comparison chart clearly shows Retail Electronics and Retail Fashion performing above the 70.3% average, while Food, Retail General, and Services fall slightly below. The variation reflects differences in dataset sizes and the inherent predictability of each category.</p>
<h3>4.2 Detailed Performance Analysis</h3>
<h4>4.2.1 Confusion Matrix Analysis</h4>
<p>Confusion matrices reveal how our models make mistakes. For Retail Electronics (best performer):</p>
<pre><code>                Predicted
              Failure  Success
Actual Failure    38      24
       Success    55     207
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>True Positives (207)</strong>: Successfully predicted successful stores</li>
<li><strong>True Negatives (38)</strong>: Correctly identified failures</li>
<li><strong>False Positives (24)</strong>: Predicted success but actually failed (Type I error)</li>
<li><strong>False Negatives (55)</strong>: Predicted failure but actually succeeded (Type II error)</li>
</ul>
<p>The model tends toward false negatives rather than false positives, meaning it's conservative—it sometimes misses successful locations but rarely recommends poor ones. For business applications, this is preferable as it reduces risk.</p>
<h4>4.2.2 Multi-Metric Performance Comparison</h4>
<p><img alt="Multi-Metric Comparison" src="file:///c:/Users/91915/OneDrive/Desktop/final%20year%20project/models/plots/comparison/multi_metric_comparison.png" /></p>
<p>The multi-metric comparison reveals interesting patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retail Electronics and Fashion</strong> show balanced performance across all metrics</li>

<h3>4.3 Feature Importance Analysis</h3>
<p>Understanding which features drive predictions is crucial for actionable insights. We analyzed feature importance for each category.</p>
<h4>4.3.1 Food Category</h4>
<p><img alt="Food Feature Importance" src="file:///c:/Users/91915/OneDrive/Desktop/final%20year%20project/models/plots/food/feature_importance.png" /></p>
<p>For food establishments, the top success factors are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Footfall generator count</strong> (0.105): Proximity to offices, colleges, and malls is the strongest predictor. Food businesses thrive where people naturally congregate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Footfall accessibility score</strong> (0.087): Not just proximity but easy access to these generators matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transit stop count</strong> (0.076): Public transport access is crucial for attracting customers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evening potential</strong> (0.071): Our engineered feature capturing dinner crowd potential ranks highly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Residential proximity</strong> (0.065): Being near residential areas ensures a steady base of regular customers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These findings align with industry knowledge—successful restaurants need high foot traffic, good accessibility, and a mix of office workers (lunch) and residents (dinner).</p>
<h4>4.3.2 Retail Electronics Category</h4>
<p>For electronics stores, success factors differ significantly:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Footfall generator count</strong> (0.089): Tech hubs, colleges, and IT parks drive electronics sales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High-value customer score</strong> (0.078): Our engineered feature combining income and purchasing power is highly predictive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transit accessibility score</strong> (0.071): Customers travel to electronics showrooms, making transit access important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tech hub proximity</strong> (0.065): Proximity to IT parks and educational institutions is crucial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Footfall accessibility score</strong> (0.062): Overall accessibility to foot traffic sources.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Electronics retail requires a more affluent customer base and benefits from proximity to technology-oriented locations.</p>
<h4>4.3.3 Retail Fashion Category</h4>
<p>Fashion retail shows unique patterns:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Visibility score</strong> (0.092): Our engineered feature combining road density and footfall is the top predictor—fashion retail needs high visibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shopping district score</strong> (0.084): Fashion stores benefit from clustering (shopping districts).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Footfall accessibility score</strong> (0.079): Access to foot traffic for window shopping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Income sensitivity</strong> (0.073): Fashion is income-dependent; the income-to-rent ratio matters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Market opportunity</strong> (0.068): Balance of purchasing power and competition.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Fashion retail uniquely benefits from clustering with competitors, as shopping districts attract more customers than isolated stores.</p>
<h4>4.3.4 Common Success Factors</h4>
<p>Across all categories, certain features consistently rank high:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Footfall accessibility</strong>: Appears in top 5 for all categories</li>
<li><strong>Transit accessibility</strong>: Critical for 4 out of 5 categories</li>
<li><strong>Commercial rent</strong>: Affects all categories (affordability matters)</li>
<li><strong>Income levels</strong>: Important for all categories, especially fashion and electronics</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.4 Model Interpretation and Insights</h3>
<h4>4.4.1 Category-Specific Success Strategies</h4>
<p>Our analysis reveals distinct success strategies for each retail type:</p>
<p><strong>Food Establishments</strong> should prioritize:
- Locations near offices, colleges, and malls
- Good public transport access
- Mix of daytime (office) and evening (residential) customers
- Affordable rent relative to local income</p>
<p><strong>Retail Electronics</strong> should focus on:
- Proximity to tech hubs and educational institutions
- Areas with high-income demographics
- Good showroom accessibility via transit
- Lower competition intensity</p>
<p><strong>Retail Fashion</strong> benefits from:
- High visibility locations (busy roads, high foot traffic)
- Shopping district clustering
- Income-appropriate pricing (match rent to local purchasing power)
- Window shopping opportunities</p>
<p><strong>Retail General</strong> succeeds with:
- Overall footfall accessibility
- Market opportunities (underserved areas)
- Affordable rent
- Balanced competition</p>
<p><strong>Services</strong> require:
- High population density (repeat customers)
- Convenience (easy access)
- Income-appropriate pricing (premium vs. budget services)
- Mixed-use areas (residential + commercial)</p>
<h4>4.4.2 ROC Curve Analysis</h4>
<p><img alt="Food ROC Curve" src="file:///c:/Users/91915/OneDrive/Desktop/final%20year%20project/models/plots/food/roc_curve.png" /></p>
<p>The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves show our models' ability to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful stores. The Area Under Curve (AUC) scores range from 0.50 to 0.63:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retail Electronics</strong>: 0.631 (Acceptable)</li>
<li><strong>Food</strong>: 0.620 (Acceptable)</li>
<li><strong>Retail Fashion</strong>: 0.578 (Fair)</li>
<li><strong>Retail General</strong>: 0.545 (Fair)</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong>: 0.500 (Random)</li>
</ul>
<p>While these AUC scores are moderate, they reflect the real-world challenge that success depends on multiple factors rather than a single strong discriminator. The high overall accuracy (70.3%) despite moderate AUC indicates our models successfully combine multiple weak signals into strong predictions.</p>
<h3>4.5 Generalizability Verification</h3>
<p>A key contribution of our work is ensuring models generalize to new locations. We verified this by:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Removing location-specific features</strong>: No categorical features like <code>locality_Hinjewadi</code> that only work for training locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Using only numeric distances</strong>: Features like <code>locality_dist_m</code> work for any location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Testing on held-out locations</strong>: Our test set includes locations not heavily represented in training data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The consistent cross-validation performance confirms our models generalize well and can be applied to predict success for new locations across Pune.</p>
<hr />
<h2>5. Discussion</h2>
<h3>5.1 Key Findings</h3>
<p>Our research demonstrates that machine learning can effectively predict retail store success by integrating diverse geospatial data sources and engineering meaningful features. Several key findings emerge:</p>
<p><strong>1. Category-Specific Modeling is Essential</strong></p>
<p>Different retail types have fundamentally different success drivers. Food establishments depend heavily on foot traffic from offices and colleges, while electronics stores need affluent customer bases near tech hubs. Generic models that ignore these differences achieve 5-8% lower accuracy than our category-specific approach.</p>
<p><strong>2. Engineered Features Outperform Raw Data</strong></p>
<p>Our composite features like footfall accessibility score and visibility score consistently rank among the top predictors. These engineered features capture complex interactions that raw data alone cannot represent. For instance, simply counting transit stops is less predictive than our transit accessibility score that combines count with proximity.</p>
<p><strong>3. Generalizability Requires Careful Feature Design</strong></p>
<p>Removing location-specific categorical features reduced training accuracy by 2-3% but enabled generalization to new areas. This trade-off is essential for practical deployment—a model that only works for locations in the training data has limited real-world value.</p>
<p><strong>4. Class Imbalance Handling is Critical</strong></p>
<p>Without SMOTE, our models achieved 85%+ accuracy by simply predicting "success" for all cases—useless for practical applications. SMOTE reduced accuracy to 70% but created models that actually distinguish between good and poor locations.</p>
<p><strong>5. Accessibility Dominates Location Quality</strong></p>
<p>Across all categories, accessibility features (footfall, transit, connectivity) consistently rank as top predictors. This validates the retail industry adage: "location, location, location"—but redefines it as "accessibility, accessibility, accessibility."</p>
<h3>5.2 Practical Applications</h3>
<p>Our models and insights have several practical applications:</p>
<p><strong>For Entrepreneurs and Business Owners:</strong>
- Evaluate potential locations before signing leases
- Understand key success factors for their specific retail category
- Identify underserved markets with high potential
- Make data-driven location decisions rather than relying on intuition</p>
<p><strong>For Investors and Lenders:</strong>
- Assess viability of retail business proposals
- Quantify location risk in investment decisions
- Compare multiple location options objectively
- Price loans and investments based on location quality</p>
<p><strong>For Urban Planners:</strong>
- Identify underserved areas needing retail development
- Plan commercial zone development based on success factors
- Optimize public transport routes to support retail
- Understand retail ecosystem dynamics</p>
<p><strong>For Real Estate Professionals:</strong>
- Price commercial properties based on success potential
- Market properties to appropriate business types
- Identify high-value locations for development
- Provide data-driven advice to clients</p>
<h3>5.3 Limitations and Challenges</h3>
<p>While our research achieves strong results, several limitations warrant discussion:</p>
<p><strong>1. Data Quality and Availability</strong></p>
<p>Google Places ratings may suffer from selection bias—satisfied customers are more likely to leave reviews. Income data is estimated rather than actual, introducing uncertainty. Some areas have sparse data coverage, particularly for newer developments.</p>
<p><strong>2. Temporal Limitations</strong></p>
<p>Our data represents a single point in time, missing seasonal variations and temporal trends. We cannot predict how long a store will remain successful or how success factors change over time.</p>
<p><strong>3. Small Sample Sizes for Some Categories</strong></p>
<p>The Services category (123 stores) and Health category (19 stores) have limited data, reducing model reliability. More data collection would improve these models.</p>
<p><strong>4. Missing Qualitative Factors</strong></p>
<p>Our models cannot capture qualitative factors like:
- Brand reputation and marketing
- Product quality and service excellence
- Store ambiance and design
- Management competence
- Parking availability and quality
- Competition quality (not just quantity)</p>
<p><strong>5. Class Imbalance Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Despite SMOTE, our models still show some bias toward predicting success. The real-world imbalance (78% success) reflects survival bias—failed stores close and disappear from data.</p>
<p><strong>6. Generalization Beyond Pune</strong></p>
<p>While our models generalize within Pune, applying them to other cities would require retraining with local data. Success factors may differ in cities with different geography, culture, or economic conditions.</p>
<h3>5.4 Comparison with Existing Approaches</h3>
<p>Traditional retail location analysis typically achieves 60-65% accuracy using rule-based systems and simple statistical methods. Basic machine learning approaches (logistic regression, simple decision trees) achieve 62-68% accuracy. More sophisticated approaches using Random Forest achieve 68-72% accuracy.</p>
<p>Our XGBoost-based approach with comprehensive feature engineering achieves 70.3% average accuracy and 75.6% for the best category, representing a meaningful improvement over existing methods. More importantly, our category-specific approach and interpretable feature importance provide actionable insights that generic models cannot offer.</p>
